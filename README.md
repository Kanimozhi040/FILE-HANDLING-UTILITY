* DOMAIN*: JAVA PROGRAMMING
* DURATION*: 4 WEEKS
* MENTOR*:NEELA SANTHOSH
* DESCRIPTION*:
  During my first internship task at CodTech IT Solutions, I had the opportunity to explore and learn core concepts of file handling in Java. Through this task, I gained a solid understanding of how to perform essential file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files using Java's I/O classes. I learned how to use FileWriter to create and write content to a file and how to read that content line by line using BufferedReader and FileReader. This helped me understand how Java interacts with the file system and how data can be written and retrieved efficiently. I also learned how to open a file in append mode to add content without overwriting the existing data. More importantly, this task taught me the importance of using try-catch blocks for proper exception handling, ensuring the program runs smoothly even when unexpected errors occur, such as missing files or permission issues. I became familiar with Javaâ€™s IOException and understood how to handle file-related errors gracefully. Additionally, I realized the significance of closing file streams after usage to prevent memory leaks and other I/O problems. I also learned how to write clean and understandable code with proper comments, which is essential for real-world projects and teamwork. This task helped me understand the structure and flow of a simple utility program, improved my confidence in using file operations in Java, and prepared me for more advanced tasks involving file processing and data storage. Overall, this task gave me a practical foundation in Java file handling, which is a valuable skill for developing applications that deal with data input and output.
